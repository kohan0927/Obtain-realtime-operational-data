# Obtain-realtime-operational-data
In automation industry, it is essential to monitor the operational status of machines. Usually the operational status can be viewed in data log and event log manners.
The monitoring device is called HMI(Human Machine Interface), which can connect to PLCs, servo, and many more and get all data from those controllers in real time. The other monitoring device is called SCADA PC, but it costs more budget than HMI in terms of software license and functionality.
Therefore, the APP is developed to have full functionality in collecting machine’s data in real-time and storing data in CSV file in a time manner on PC. This way provides a cost-effective solution to the automation industry companies.
